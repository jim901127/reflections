How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff is very useful to compare two similar text files. It only shows the blocks that contain the differences so that it is easier for us to find.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can find your bugs in the program more easily and more organized.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It has more flexibility but may have mistakes by human.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It suits programming since a lot of files will be correlated and they don't need to be commit separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
First find the commit according to description. Then use diff to see what are changed in detail.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can now make any changes without worrying doing some stupid mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Some simples files maybe, just to learn some basic functions.
