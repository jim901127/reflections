What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Let git know that I want to keep track of the repository. Because not all folders need to be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A copy of files. I can edit whatever I want before I decide to commit.
