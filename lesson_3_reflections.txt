When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share code to others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes may be good or bad, especially when the code is not submitted by me.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Unlike clone, forks adds an independent repository and any commit later will not be saved for the original repository. Branches are more like a user version fork.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Keep track of how long I have go with my local changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would discuss with my collaborators each time we have some progress or conflict. Using Git would definitely be much easier.
